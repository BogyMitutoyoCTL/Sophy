**Measurements**

The length of the distance has to be stated in millimeters.



**How to install the light barriers**

The light barriers have to be installed at a position
in which they can't be interrupted by an object which
should not interrupt them. Especially at the "Aquasol", the
light barriers should not be reachable for a person which isn't in the slide yet. 
If the light barrier isn't installed in the right way,
we can't guarantee the accuracy of our measurement results.
